Hey, this is ShareMyBooks, a puny contribution to the cause of saving our planet which is in grave danger from homo sapiens.
Really guys, how did we screw up so badly?

You can buy/sell your old books at ShareMyBooks and save trees, which by the way really are important.

How to run on CS50 IDE:

Go to the directory project by running the following command in terminal window-

            cd project

I assume you were not in a cave for last 50 years and can navigate through the simple interface of the web app.
